// 4. Think of a number between 1 and 100, but don't tell this to the computer.
// Once the computer guesses a number based on the rules seen in exercise 3,
// tell the computer if your number is greater than, less than, or equal to the
// guess of the computer. The computer continues guessing until it guesses your
// number correctly.
